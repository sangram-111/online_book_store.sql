# online_book_store.sql
This is a hands-on SQL project I created to simulate the backend of an online book store. The idea was to replicate a simple version of how real e-commerce platforms manage their book inventory, customer orders, and sales data using relational databases.

Project Overview
The system includes a set of interrelated tables designed to handle:

A Books table to manage book details such as title, author, price, stock, and category

A Customers table to store user data

An Orders table to track purchases with quantity and date

An optional Categories table for grouping books into genres or themes

The goal was not just to build a database but to understand how to write queries that can help answer practical business questions.

Key Features
Well-structured schema with proper use of primary and foreign keys

Querying data using SQL operations like JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, subqueries, and aggregate functions

Real-world use cases such as:

Finding the most frequently ordered book

Calculating remaining stock after sales

Tracking monthly revenue

Analyzing customer activity and order trends

Tools Used
SQL (compatible with MySQL or PostgreSQL)

Manual data insertion for testing

Basic schema design and relationship mapping

What I Learned
Working on this project gave me a much deeper understanding of how relational databases support e-commerce systems. It helped me connect SQL theory with real-life business problems like inventory tracking, customer behavior analysis, and sales reporting.
